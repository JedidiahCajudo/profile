          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I’m a web developer specializing in bringing businesses into the modern era with smooth and responsive web applications. I design the user interface, set up the backend, and deploy it online. I am most passionate about building something that works well and looks appealing.</p>
          <p>Most recently, I graduated from an intensive bootcamp, LeWagon for fullstack development. Languages I learned were JavaScript, Ruby, SCSS. Libraries I learned were React, Tailwind, Stimulus, Hotwire, Turbo, and Rails. Other tools I learned were GitHub, Heroku, Cloudinary, and Figma.</p>
          <p>Based in Tokyo, Japan, I’m usually taking photos around the city or getting a ramen or coffee.</p>
